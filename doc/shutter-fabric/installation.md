# Installing Shutter
Shutter is available for Fabric on versions `1.16.5`, `1.17.1`, `1.18.2`, and `1.19.2`. We do not currently support any other versions or modloaders. 

## Getting Started
Before you can download and install shutter, you must first have installed fabric and created a modded instance of Minecraft. For a walkthrough on this you can go the Fabric wiki to install manually.
