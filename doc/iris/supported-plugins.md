### MyWorlds

MyWorlds is our suggested world manager plugin. It properly calls Native Minecraft Source functions we need to run our plugin.

### Multiverse

Multiverse is a (newly) supported world management plugin. Requires modification before it can be used.

### PhantomWorlds

PhantomWorlds is another suggested World Management plugin. Barebones, so MyWorlds is still suggested over it.
