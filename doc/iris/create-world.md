# How to Create a World

Iris allows you to generate stunning custom worlds with unique terrain, biomes, and structures. Follow this guide to create and manage your own dimension.  

---

## Preparation  
Before creating a world, ensure you have:  
- ✅ **Iris installed** on your Spigot/Paper server. Grab the latest jar from [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/iris-world-gen-the-dimension-engine.84586/), [BuiltByBit](https://builtbybit.com/resources/iris-dimension-engine.56258/?ref=discover) or [Polymart](https://polymart.org/product/3623/iris-dimension-engine)

- ✅ **Sufficient RAM** (at least 6GB recommended for large worlds).  
- ✅ **Proper permission manager**: We recommend [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/).
- ✅ **Proper permissions** (OP or `iris.world.create` permission).  

> Do not give yourself the `iris.*` or `*` permission, as this can cause conflicts.
