# HoloUi
NextGen immersive in world menus and mechanics. HoloUi allows servers to display placeholders, images, text and more as buttons, toggles, and static elements on an x/y grid that can be rendered in front of the player when they run the command for the menu they have permission for. Holoui has a web editor that allows you to quickly create new menus for quick download and install on your server. The web editor is hosted seperatly, and does not connect to your server.
