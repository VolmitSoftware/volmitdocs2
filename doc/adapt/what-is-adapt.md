# What is Adapt?

> This document is a work in progress. As the plugin updates changes may occur or something may become broken.
{.is-warning}


Adapt is a drag-and-drop solution for balanced passive abilities and skills that players can enjoy on a server. There are over 100 abilities that are fresh and unique for you and your players to enjoy!

Adapt Abilities are all accessible in the in-game GUI using `/adapt gui` or by right-clicking any bookshelf. Adapt provides a more user-friendly experience to a "skills" system. Most servers want to increase the quality of the vanilla experience. Most Skill based plugins are about powers, game-breaking systems, and riddles with bugs. That's where Adapt comes in. Lightweight on the server, and providing mere quality of life enhancements to a user's experience.
