# Enchanting

## Quick-Click Enchant

You can Enchant Books, and apply them onto armor that is available! (you nolonger need to spend XP putting books onto armor/weapons) and these have a maximum set by the skill level.

These 2 Skills refund you lapis and experience as you enchant in a single session, more is refunded the more you spend.
