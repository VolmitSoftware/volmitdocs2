# Excavation

## Hasty Excavator

When you start mining a block you are given a burst of haste 1-3 by default for a moment, not as powerful as the potion effect but good for burst mining lighter blocks with ease!

## Super-Seeing Spelunker

This skill is literally wallhacks, but with a consumption base! Using the glow-berries and having an ore in your hand you are able to locate nearby ores with your heightened senses!

## OMNI - T.O.O.L.

This tool is one of the strongest you can have in your arsenal! This tool allows you so Shift-click a tool in your inventory and COMBINE them tohether! This tool will also inteligently swap based on what you click on, So if you have a shovel and a axe as a multitool, they will swap when breaking/tilling dirt, or Mining/stripping logs independently.\
Notes:\
\- The Tool will break all of the tools if even 1 is broken\
\- Each item is its own item so you can swap to the tool, and enchant without enchanting others\
\- Sneak, and Drop the Multitool to Deconstruct the scaffold and get all the tools back. \
\- This is also a great way of storing lots of tools at once!\
\- People who don't have the skill cant use the swapping mechanic

## Shovel Drop-to-Inventory

When mining a block that has Drops (This goes for any Drop-to-inventory skill) All items that drop from it will be teleported to your inventory, INCLUDING things in containers like chests and so on, should you break it with a DTI skill
