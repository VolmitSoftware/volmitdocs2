# Rift

## Rift Resistance

Using any of the rift skills, or Enderperals / Eyes in general will provide you with a variable boost of resistance, There is nothing to show in terms of effects, as its all passives. but the resistance can be up to 80% by default when recalling to a point.

## Remote Access

You can craft a Bound item that acts like a gateway to a block in a world. With this you bind it to a block location and if its a container you can open and access it (you need permission ofc) but The block can be broken, and replaced with something else by a friend or yourself and you can access this new container! **Works Cross Worlds.**
