# Shutter

Shutter aims to provide an efficent workflow for creators, such as builders, map makers, and youtubers with a quick means to capture cinematic footage in game. Shutter brings full camera dolly and node based path creation to Minecraft. It aims to be simple, and lightweight, while still packing all the basic requirements.

Shutters core functionality is in stark contrast to mods like ReplayMod, which can only be accessed by leaving the game, and creating your paths with the recording, which takes time, and is disruptive for many workflows. Shutter intends to bring back the quality tools of older minecraft like CMDcam and Minema.
